                <h2>Welcome to the Galaxy!</h2>
                <p>In gratitude for your heroic deeds, the Galaxy Federation has decided to reward you with your own planet, and they've given you a nice chunk of change to go along with it. Use this money to design your planet and help its inhabitants. The federation is pretty stingy though, so once you run out of money, the game is over, and you'll have to try again!</p>
                <p>The goal of the game is to build a beautiful planet but not go over your budget. You will be rewarded for staying within budget, plus an added bonus if you wind up with money left over! Good luck, commander. The Federation is rooting for you!</p>
